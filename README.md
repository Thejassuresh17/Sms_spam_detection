# Sms_spam_detection

Uses machine learning to classify messages as spam or not spam.
Involves text preprocessing ,vectorization and prediction using the model which uses Multinomial Naive Bayes with Tf-idf vectorizor.
Just run the app.py file and you are good to go.
I have also attached the .pynb file where I trained the model on the entire dataset ,did EDA and chose the best working algo and vectroizer combo.
